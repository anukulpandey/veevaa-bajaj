                      Some carvers say that the V-tool is just two chisels
                      joined to form a V. But the primary function of this tool
                      is to separate areas when outlining, adding detail,
                      texturing, it is also known as parting tool. The
                      difference between the V and the gouge, is that the V
                      gives you a wall rather than a valley.
